## Why capitalists buy into the obvious lie of the meritocracy

The "meritocracy" refers to the idea that hard work/better ideas leads to success. This is demonstrably false; they can give you an edge but luck plays a much larger factor (luck in this case can be any forces out of your control). So why is it such a popular lie?

* People on the "inside" often know it's a lie...
* ...but they don't have to admit it, so they can construct an image of a "self-made" individual
* People on the outside sometimes don't know it's a lie, which can be enough to keep them invested in a system that is working against them
* Lack of alternatives also keeps people invested

However, there is a more subtle effect at work here

* The lie hides the actual mechanisms of power and control inherent to being "successful"
* This provides a screen: People who taste success for the first time are likely to be pushed back out due to not understanding how to maintain that success
* Structural inequality acts as a secondary check: People who the powerful want to promote often have multiple chances at success so they eventually become successful
* Those that do not can be given additional chances and are also likely to reproduce the system that made them successful
* People who the powerful want to expel often lack the resources for additional chances, so it can be permanent when the system forces them out the first time

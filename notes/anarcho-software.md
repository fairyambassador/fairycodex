## Purpose of anarchist software

Anarchist software takes the cultural space of social networking. Its goal is not to build out a social network, but to facilitate building self-sufficient communities. In the event of a crisis or large tasks, communities can be composed into a supercommunity that functions in the same manner as the communities that comprise it. This is the true goal of this software -- to facilitate scaling to match the size of challenges without discarding the anarchist priciples that made the community possible in the first place.

## Purpose of anarchist software

Anarchist software takes the cultural space of social networking. Its goal is not to build out a social network, but to facilitate building self-sufficient communities. In the event of a crisis or large tasks, communities can be composed into a supercommunity that functions in the same manner as the communities that comprise it. This is the true goal of this software -- to facilitate scaling to match the size of challenges without discarding the anarchist priciples that made the community possible in the first place.

An equally important goal is to prove and teach the methods of anarchist organizing. We have seen how algorithms and UX built into social media software trains its users to act in certain ways. Likewise, it should be possible to train users in anarchist organizing by making it the natural way to interact with the software. This in turn shows users that anarchist organization is possible and how it is done, so when a user decides organize for another goal (e.g. union organizing), their reaction is not "what do I do and how do I get involved" but "this is just like using the software, so I already know what to do."

## Goals of anarchist software

* Composable communities
* Secure communication / organizing
* Minimize energy needed to run the community
* No delegation of power
* Asynchronous, inclusive community processes
* Counteract accumulation and have consequences for accumulators
 * In particular, community management should not have to be a full-time job
 * Community managers should not have outsized influence on the community
* Avoid centralized architecture
* No private property, community provides framework for stewardship
 * Multiple communities can have stewardship over the same resources
 * Personal property is respected
* When the software fails, fall back to people

## Features of anarchist software

* Modular architecture
* Asynchronous
* Very resource light, should run on a phone
* Community forks are organic and non-disruptive
* Robust design: Assume any single or multiple points may be compromised at any time

## Modules for anarchist software

* Governance (making decisions)
 * Mechanism for making decisions (async consensus)
 * Creating/disbanding working groups
 * Keeping records of decisions
* Administration (running the community, validating qualifications)
 * Keeping track of qualifications
 * Assigning members to working groups
 * Enforcing membership restrictions
 * Stewardship (how does this work?)
 * Keeping records of assignments
* Economy (management of resources)
 * Keeping track of resources
 * Issuing currency
 * Funding working groups
 * Keeping records of transactions
* Expression (communication, public image)
 * Hosting the public page
 * Facilitating communication (like chat)
 * Operating community-wide channels
 * Facilitating emergency contact
 * Keeping records of communications
* Justice (addressing grievances, managing conflict)
 * Managing the grievance process
 * Managing the reconciliation/repair process
 * Restricting membership privileges
 * Keeping records of decisions and restrictions
* Defense (responding to external threats)
 * Applying external restrictions
 * Organizing defensive working groups
* Foreign Affairs? (Not sure if this needs to be a module)

Each module includes a "prime working group" that manages making major decisions for that module. Full members are chosen at random to serve on the prime working groups, and serve only for short periods of time (2 weeks?). Terms on the prime working groups cannot be extended. The prime working groups cannot be disbanded. The prime working groups also cannot make decisions on their own; all "prime decisions" must be made by consensus of the group.

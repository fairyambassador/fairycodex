## The Conservative Argument for Equality

Why is it that leftists constantly feel betrayed by people are in solidarity while demanding equality for themselves or their group, then once they get it, turn on those who are still fighting for equality? Can't they understand that we're all in this together?

In my experience, there are two major types of arguments for equality (likely there are more than two in actuality) -- A leftist argument and a conservative argument. We rarely if ever distinguish between the two, so we are caught off guard when this happens. I believe it is vital to start distinguishing between them, first because we can avoid being caught off-guard by it, and second because I believe the two can be distinguished before equality is gained, thereby allowing stronger solidarity to be built.

### The Leftist Argument

The leftist argument is the one we are most familiar with: An injury to one is an injury to all and what-not. That oppression is systemic, and as long as the system exists to oppress some, it can and will be used to oppress all, just at different times and in different measures. The leftist answer to this is to dismantle the oppressive system (or dismantle hierarchy itself) to prevent oppression.

### The Conservative Argument

Conservatives believe that hierarchy is natural and inevitable, so dismantling systems of oppression (or dismantling hierarchy) is seen as futile at best or dangerous at worst. However, conservatives are constantly in conversation (or argument) over what the hierarchy should look like, where the lines should be drawn between groups, and what privileges each group should enjoy. Thus, the conservative argument for equality typically boils down to "I (and those like me) am in the wrong group" or "I (and those like me) should be given more privileges."

These arguments are often self-serving, though not necessarily out of malice. People tend to place a lot of value on their own experiences, so conservatives can argue that they *know* they are in the wrong group because they've lived the experience. A conservative can sometimes be convinced to support rights for a group by being exposed to upstanding members of that group, since they gain lived experience of how those members are "in the wrong place."

However, it's notable that these conservative arguments are not scalable, and that is *by design*. They only apply narrowly to proven members of a group, and those rights are also revokable. To conservatives, who are primarily concerned with the "correct" shape of society, both the narrow grant of rights and the possibility of rewriting who enjoys those rights are considered desired and responsible ways of shaping society.

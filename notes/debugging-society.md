## Debugging Society

It strikes me that correcting systemic issues in society could be tackled with a process similar to debugging code.

* If undesired outcomes are simply patched over, we end up with "spaghetti code" society -- Very complicated and very fragile, sensitive to small changes.
* In order to solve problems, a deep dive into the system to see exactly factors are causing the undesired outcome is necessary. Just like with coding, this process is time consuming and takes time to explain.
* Since the root causes of the issue are hidden from surface inspection, likewise will the effects of the fix be hidden from surface inspection.
* Similar to the process of explaining technical solutions to non-technical partners, care must be taken to explain them at the level of your audience. However, detailed explanations/documentation should be available for others to reproduce the trace and the fix.

The attention economy reinforces mis/disinformation. To effectively counter bad info, it needs to be presented in a "context sandwich" -- First, the context of the statement needs to be explained, then the bad info can be presented, then the bad info can be deconstructed and debunked. In order to get people's attention, media leads with the bad statement, which decontextualizes it and therefore amplifies it. This amplification happens even if the outlet attempts to debunk or contextualize the statement later; to be effective, the context has to be presented before statements (good or bad) can be evaluated.

* Anarcho-progressive means the foundation to build a better society exists now; the tools just have to be built
* Technology is scale. It enables "new" things by reducing the amount of energy it takes to do existing things.
* Incentives can be built into technology, and tech can train users to understand/accept incentives, behaviors, ideologies. This is not new, but modern scale is
* It is not enough for an anarchist society to be possible on it's own. It must be built to survive and subvert existing hegemonies.
* For an ideology to take hold, it must be efficient in the energy/effort it demands of it's adherents. Capitalism and hierarchy are very efficient in how they use energy.
* For a system to compete, following it must be more energy efficient. This will give it a natural advantage, as the existing system requires more energy to uphold.
* This is one reason "liberal democracy" is such a failure. The amount of energy required to keep it fair and functional is so high that it buckles under sustained assault from oligarchy.
